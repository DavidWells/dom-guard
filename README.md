# DOM Guard

Stop scammers from the manipulating DOM. [See demo](https://dom-guard.netlify.app)

## About

Scammers are using dev tools to manipulate values in pages to trick unsuspecting victims into sending them money. These victims are typically the elderly. ðŸ˜¢

They connect to their victim's machines via remote desktop software under the guise of tech support or some other well known company.

The scammer then attempts to convince the victim they have received a larger than expected "refund" by manipulating the victim's bank user interface via chrome dev tools with the goal of getting the victim to mail them cash.

See this video for [how the refund scams work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4mkZU2Y0as).

DOMGuard is a small javascript library (~130 lines of code) & proof of concept to help put an end to these criminals.

## How does this work?

Any changes attempted via Javascript are detected by MutationObserver.

Additionally, guarded DOM nodes are checked via a "hearbeat" every `500ms` to ensure the values are what they should be.

## Install

```bash
npm install dom-guard
```

})

guard.init()

// Turn off guard
guard.disable()
